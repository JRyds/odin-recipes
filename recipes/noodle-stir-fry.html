    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Stir-frying is a Chinese cooking technique that involves cooking food in a wok over high heat. It requires you to constantly toss the ingredients to make them crispy without burning them.It is a particularly popular method for vegetables, noodles, and lean meats such as chicken, especially if they are cut into small uniform pieces.
    Although stir-frying is a cooking method, it is the name of a dish in several non-Asian countries. Some popular stir fry dishes include beef stir fry, chicken stir fry, and vegetable stir fry.</p>

    <p>It canâ€™t be stirred fried noodles without the noodles, right? While you can use any noodle for stir fry, it is best to opt for thicker and longer noodles that are easy to work with.If you are a beginner, standard egg noodles are a great option, preferably the fresh variety, as they are easy to handle. Once you are more comfortable and get the hang of it, you may try other options as well.</p>
